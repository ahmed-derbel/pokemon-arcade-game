# Frogger Arcade Game (pokemon themed)
## Summary
Frogger Arcade game is a slight cariation of the classic Frogger Arcade Game developed by Konami. I made this game as a project that is part of the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree. 

## How to play the game
 When the pokemon reach the water, you win and start the next level.for each level the number of poke balls will increase and it will became harder to escape and reach the water safely. If you run into a pokemon ball, you will be catched and lose and the game will start over. THe balls are running across the screen at random locations and random speeds. 
Use the arrow keys to move left, right, forward or backward.
